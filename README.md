# Capstone Project: Chinook Database Analysis & PowerBI Visualizations

## ‚ú® **About the Project**
This project was carried out within the scope of **Upschool SQL & Power BI Capstone Project** program. Database analysis was performed using Chinook database and detailed and meaningful visualization solutions were created with Power BI.

The project aims to use data analysis processes effectively with SQL queries and present the outputs with visual dashboards.

4. **What are customers' preferred payment methods?
5. **How are sales trends changing over the years?
6. **What strategic recommendations can be developed based on sales data?
